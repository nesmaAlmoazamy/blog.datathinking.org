### üìÄü§î Research Question: How does sentiment analysis using different methods impact the classification of sentiment and the identification of sentiment trends?

### üßêüí∞ Rationale: 
Sentiment analysis is a widely used technique in various domains, including marketing, social media analysis, and customer feedback analysis. Understanding the sentiment behind textual data can provide valuable insights and inform decision-making processes. However, the accuracy and reliability of sentiment analysis methods are crucial for drawing meaningful conclusions. The research question aims to investigate the impact of using different methods, specifically comparing a flawed method with a pretrained transformer-based method, on sentiment classification and trend analysis.

The rationale behind this question is to highlight the potential pitfalls of relying on inaccurate or flawed sentiment analysis methods. By demonstrating how the misclassification of sentiment can occur and how it can be improved using more advanced techniques like pretrained transformers, the research aims to emphasize the importance of robust and reliable analysis methods.

The decisions regarding which sentiment analysis method to use and how to interpret the sentiment trends will need to be made by the individuals or organizations relying on the analysis results. Researchers, data analysts, marketing professionals, and decision-makers in various industries may be involved in making these decisions.

### üßêüí∞ Stakes: The stakeholders who have skin in the game and bear material consequences include:

Researchers and Data Analysts: Their credibility and the validity of their research can be affected by the accuracy of sentiment analysis methods. They may face reputational risks if flawed methods are used, leading to incorrect conclusions or misleading trends.

Marketing Professionals:  analysis plays a crucial role in understanding customer sentiment towards products, brands, and campaigns. If inaccurate  analysis leads to incorrect insights, it can impact marketing strategies, customer engagement, and brand reputation.

Decision-Makers: Managers and executives who rely on data analysis to make informed decisions may face the consequences of inaccurate analysis. Poor decisions based on flawed analysis can lead to financial losses, misaligned strategies, or missed opportunities.

Systems and Platforms: Data analysis techniques are often integrated into various systems and platforms, such as social media monitoring tools or customer feedback analysis platforms. If these systems utilize flawed methods, their users may receive inaccurate data analysis scores and trends, impacting the overall effectiveness and value of the platforms.
